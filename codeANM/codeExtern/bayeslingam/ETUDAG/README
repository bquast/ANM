This is the Easy To Use DAG package README
The package is still under development.

The package is coded by Antti Hyttinen <antti.hyttinen@cs.helsinki.fi>
	and Doris Entner <doris.entner@cs.helsinki.fi> 
		(additions to hidden variable DAGs and d-separation code)
	and Patrik Hoyer <patrik.hoyer@cs.helsinki.fi>
		(some structures and functions are copied from his code)

There three types of 'DAGs' used

cdag - presentation with order and the lower diagonal of the b-matrix
bdag - the b matrix, possibly in binary (B(i,j)=1 if i<-j )
mdag - markov equivalence class of dags, pattern, partially oriented dag, 
       B(i,j)= 1 if i<-j
       B(i,j)= 2 if i->j
       B(i,j)= 3 if i-j
       this is the definition of a pattern used in the PC algorithm package
tdag - a text form of dag, as in the deal package

The functions use these at the moment quite wildly but
  if the argument is BDAG then the function wants a bdag,
  if the argument is MBDAG it accepts an mdag or a bdag
  if the argument is BDAGs the a list of bdags is ok, that is 3 dimensional matrix
    where the last index denotes the dag index, so BDAGs[,,3] is a bdag.


Call loadETUDAG() to load the package.

Some functions are not yet implemented.
