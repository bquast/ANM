CORRESPONDING PAPER
===
This code is supplementary material for 
J. Peters, J. Mooij, D. Janzing, B. Sch\"olkopf: "Causal Discovery with Continuous Additive Noise Models", JMLR 2014


===
PACKAGES
===
This code requires a couple of R-packages. Install them by starting R and running
> install.packages(mgcv)
> install.packages(pcalg)
> install.packages(kernlab)
> install.packages(igraph)
> install.packages(parallel)
> install.packages(mgcv)
> install.packages(gptk)
> install.packages(clue)
> install.packages(mboost)
> install.packages(glmnet)
> source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
> biocLite(c("graph","RBGL")) 



===
EXAMPLE
===
After starting R in this folder run 
> source("./code/experiments/ANM/exampleSEMIND.R", chdir = TRUE)
(You can disable brute force to save some time.)

===
MAIN FUNCTIONS FOR RESIT, GDS AND BRUTE FORCE
===
The main functions can be found in
"YOURPATH/code/inferDAG/"
including the functions GDS.R, BruteForce.R, ICML.R ("RESIT"). To load all necessary files for GDS, for example, run
> source("./code/startups/startupGDS.R", chdir = TRUE)
Most of these functions take a (sample size x dimension) dimensional matrix as input and provide (a score and) an adjacency matrix as output.


===
EXPERIMENTS FROM PAPER
===
The simulation experiments can be found in the folder 
"YOURPATH/code/experiments/ANM/"
In principle, you can run
> source("./code/experiments/ANM/experiment2Sparsep4.R", chdir = TRUE) 
Note, however, that you may want to change the number of cores (currently all set to one). Otherwise the code might take very long to finish.

DISCLAIMER AND QUESTIONS
===
I am sorry that some parts of the code are not well documented yet.
The code is not optimized for speed either.
Please send me an email if there are any open questions.
